# PAPERCUP - SERVER BOILERPLATE

Welcome to this repository which sets up a server using the following technologies.

* NodeJS

This is technology we will be using to run the backend. This allows us to code in javascript in the frontend and backend, keeping it very consistent.

* Express

Express is the framework that we will use to render the NodeJS server. This is a heavily used, heavily maintained with many modules extending its functionality. There is a lot of documentation out there on express too.
